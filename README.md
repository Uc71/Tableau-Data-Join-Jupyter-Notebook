# Tableau-Data-Join-Jupyter-Notebook
I noticed that the original CSVs for my Tableau homework had some stations reported as being in Canada.
I had to fix this error in Python.
I read in my 5 CSVs as DataFrames, then represented each one with a variable and concatenated all 5 variables.
I then eliminated all stations with latitudes>45.
This eliminated all the "Canadian" stations.
Then, I renamed the DF columns with more descriptive names, and gave the names proper capitalization and spelling which had been lacking.
I then exported my fixed, completed DF to a CSV to use in my Tableau visualizations.
